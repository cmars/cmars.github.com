This is a first post made with Pelican. I wanted a blogging platform that:

- Works with Github pages. So, a static-compiled blog.
- Is written in a language I'd feel comfortable hacking on (Golang or Python).
- Mostly just works and doesn't get in the way.

I settled on Pelican_. So far, I'm liking it quite a bit. I had to tweak the Makefile a bit to get the ``make github`` target to work for a personal Github page, but it works. `This blog's project page`__ might be helpful if you're trying to get this working.
